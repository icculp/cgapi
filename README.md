Simple CoinGecko API access for price data

With small investments in crypto scattered across multiple exchanges, it has become difficult for my friends and I to track our numerous tiny holdings to determine total net holdings. 

The purpose of this project is to have API request code easily accessible for us crypto enthusiasts to use in creating a google sheets dashboard to monitor crypto holdings across multiple exchanges.

Each file represents a function that obtains the price data for a specific asset and returns the value back to the active spreadsheet. This is a simple api request using google script inside of google sheets to access price data via the Coin Gecko API. 

How-to coming soon with explanation on how to build your own dashboard...
